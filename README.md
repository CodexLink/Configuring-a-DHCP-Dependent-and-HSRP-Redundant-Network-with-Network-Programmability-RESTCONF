# DevOps `(CPE 028)` Final Case Study

A Final Case Study of DevOps - Application of Network Automation and Programmability, also known as: **Configuring a DHCP-Dependent and Redundant Network with Network Programmability (*RESTCONF*)**

## Introduction

This repository (case study) contains the resources needed to accomplish a laboratory activity that utilizes the capabilities of RESTCONF on Cisco Devices equipped with IOS-XE software. This repository also contains the generated outputs produced from the script.

## Requirements
Each folders in this repository contains use-case and categorization.

## Background / Scenario
As a final requirement for the DevOps (CPE 028), you will be required to configure a topology with RESTCONF under one territory that heavily relies on DHCP servers for addressing, with redundancy added for both DHCP and HSRP, incorporated from one another; and also OSPF as an alternative for IP routing. Default and static configuration are prohibited from this activity.

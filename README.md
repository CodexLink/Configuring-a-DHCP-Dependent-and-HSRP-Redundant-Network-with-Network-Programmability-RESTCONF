A Final Case Study of DevOps - Application of Network Automation and Programmability


## Introduction
This case study is a laboratory activity that utilizes the capabilities of RESTCONF on cisco device with IOS XE Software. Network topics is OSPF for routing, DHCP for automatic IP assignment and HSRP for redundant connections.

## Requirements
Each folders in this repository contains use-case and categorization.

## Background / Scenario
As a final requirement for the DevOps (CPE 028), you will be required to configure a topology with RESTCONF under one territory that heavily relies on DHCP servers for addressing, with redundancy added for both DHCP and HSRP, incorporated from one another; and also OSPF as an alternative for IP routing. Default and static configuration are prohibited from this activity.
